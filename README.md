Point of Sale System was very crucial for many small businesses. This enables business owners, managers, accountants, and cashiers to add new sales while also monitoring all storage and transactions within the system.

> 
> This system was also built with Font Awesome, ChartJS, and DataTables.

This was a requirement for completing the Capstone project of a group of students from Lucena City.
